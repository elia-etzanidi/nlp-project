During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission — the one we were waiting for since last autumn, but the updates were confusing as it not included the full feedback from reviewer or maybe editor. Anyway, I believe the team, although a bit delayed and less communication at recent days, they really tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came finally last week, I think. Also, kindly remind me please, if the doctor still plans for the acknowledgments section edit before he sends again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so. Overall, let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets.
