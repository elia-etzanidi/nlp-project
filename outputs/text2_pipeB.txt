During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission – the one we were waiting for since last autumn - but the updates were confusing as it did not include the full feedback from reviewer or maybe editor. Nevertheless, I think the team, although they have been a little delayed and less communication in recent days, tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful to Springer for their acceptance, especially for their efforts. The doctor is still planning for an edit of the acknowledgements section when he sends again. Because I didn’t see the part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize. Ultimately, let us take great pride in the outcome of our efforts and celebrate the success with strong coffee and future targets.
