At our final discuss we talked about the new submission. We had been waiting for it since autumn. It was confusing and was missing some feedback from the reviewers. I believe that I believe the team has really tried for paper and cooperation. I think we should be thankful for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came, last week. The doctor is still planning to have the acknowledgments section edited before he sends again. I hope that I didnâ€™t see that final part because I may have missed it. Overall, let's make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets.
