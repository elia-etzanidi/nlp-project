During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission — the one we were waiting for since last autumn, but the updates were confusing as it didn't include the full feedback from reviewer or maybe editor. I believe the team, although a bit delayed and less communication at recent days, they really tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came last week. Also, kindly remind me, if the doctor still plans for the acknowledgments section edit before he sends again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so. Let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets.
