I told him about the new submission we were waiting for since last autumn, but the updates were confusing as they didn't include the full feedback from the reviewer or editor. I think the team tried their best for paper and cooperation despite being a bit delayed and less communication recently. We should be thankful for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came last week, I think. If the doctor still plans for the acknowledgments section to be edited before he sends again, please remind me. I apologize if I missed that part final because I didn't see it yet. Let's make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with coffee and targets in the future.
