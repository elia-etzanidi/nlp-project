During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission, which we were waiting for since last autumn, but the updates were confusing as it did not contain the full feedback from the editor or the reviewer. I believe that although they are a bit delayed and less communication at recent days, they really tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came finally last week, I think. Also, kindly remind me please, if the doctor still plans for the acknowledgments section edit before he sends again. Because I didn't see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so. Let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets.
